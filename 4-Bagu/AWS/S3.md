# Basic Level 
## What is bucket? 
- Top level container for objects 
- Globally unique name per aws account 
- think of it like a folder that holds objects 

## What is Object in S3?
- Actual file stored in S3 
- Each object consists of 3 parts:
  - **Key**: Unique identifier for each object in the bucket(can mimic directories, like: `images/2026/photo.jpg`)
  - **Data**: The content of the object(file contents, eg: PDF, image, CSV)
  - **Metadata**: System-managed or user-defined metadata(like content type, custom tags)
## How does key design in Objects of S3?
- Keys are unique with each other per bucket.
- Using / in a key simulates a folder hierarchy.
```shell
Key = documents/reports/Feb.pdf
# Here, documents/reports/ is just a prefix, not a real folder
```
## What type of storage is Amazon S3: block, file, or object?
objects
## What are the three main components of an S3 object?
Object = Data + Metadata + Key 
- data: real content 
- metadata: http headers/user-defined metadata 
- key: unique identifiers(path)
bucket is not component of object, but container
## Does S3 have real directories? How are folders represented?
No. S3 has no real directories, folder use key prefix to simulate, like below: 
```shell 
bucket: my-bucket 
key: images/2025/photo.jpg 
# images/2025 is part of key
# bucket is top level container 
```
## What is the maximum size of a single S3 object?
5TB
##Can you mount S3 as a filesystem like EBS or EFS?
No. 

S3 is Object Storage. No POSIX semantics, File Locking, Random Write

EBS/EFS is designed for file system 

## What does “11 nines durability” mean in S3?
99.999999999%
## Is durability the same thing as availability?
##Does S3 automatically store data across multiple Availability Zones?
## Is S3 strongly consistent or eventually consistent?
Strong Consistency. 

New Object
## After uploading a new object, can it be read immediately?
Yes. S3 support Strongly Consistency to immediately read after uploads 

## Does S3 provide strong consistency for overwrite and delete operations?
Yes

## What happens if you upload a file to S3 using the same key again?
- Without versioning, replace old object 
- With versioning, generate new version, maintain old version

## What is multipart upload used for?
large dataset, distributed upload

## Is multipart upload the same as partial update?
Multipart upload will generate whole object in the end through multiple part uploading distributedly 

## Name two ways to control access to S3
- IAM policy 
- Bucket policy 

## What is the difference between an IAM policy and a bucket policy?
- IAM
  - for role/user
  - control what this role can do 
- Bucket 
  - for bucket 
  - control who can access this bucket 
  - support across account 

## Is data in S3 encrypted by default?
Yes, server-side encryption by default 

## What AWS service manages encryption keys for SSE-KMS?
AWS KMS 

## What is the default S3 storage class?
S3 standard
## Which storage class is designed for long-term archival?
S3 Glacier Deep Archive 

## What is One Zone-IA, and what is the main trade-off?
- Data stored in single AZ 
- low cost, low durability 
- Data invalid if invalid AZ

## Does deleting an object permanently remove it when versioning is enabled?
No. Deletion will mark current version as `delete`, old version still exist, able to recover. 

## What is an S3 lifecycle policy used for?
Auto-manage storage status and expiry of objects. 
- Automatically transfer old object to lower storage(IA/Glacier)
- Automatically delete overdued objects 

## How can an application temporarily grant access to a private S3 object?
- Use pre-signed URL: generate an URL with `expiration` field, any one with this URL can access object temporarily

## Name one AWS service that can be triggered by S3 events
Lambda, SQS, SNS 
- Can trigger event to handle after creation, deletion or archive of objects, eg: S3 Event Notification

## Is S3 suitable for storing database transaction logs directly?
Not ideal. S2 is object storage, lacks random write and low latency; Transaction log usually need ordered write, frequently write and low latency, like EBS. 

## Can S3 be used as a boot disk for EC2?
No, EC2 use EBS to mount boot disk. S3 does not support random write and file system semantic 

## Can multiple users upload unlimited objects to the same bucket?
Yes, S3 bucket can infinitly scale, support mutil-users uploads 

# Medium 

## What are the differences between S3 Standard, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, and Glacier storage classes?
- S3 Standard: high availability, low latency, frequent access.
- Standard-IA (Infrequent Access): lower cost, same durability, retrieval cost for infrequent access.
- One Zone-IA: stored in a single AZ, lower cost, lower resilience.
- Glacier / Deep Archive: archival, long retrieval times, very low cost.

## How does S3 ensure 11 nines durability across Availability Zones?
- Data is automatically replicated across multiple AZs.
- Checksums and background integrity checks detect and repair bit rot.
- Designed to withstand loss of an entire AZ without data loss.
## Explain how S3 versioning works and how it affects object overwrites and deletes.
- Each PUT creates a new version ID.
- Overwriting an object doesn’t delete the previous version.
- DELETE adds a delete marker; older versions still exist.
## How can you recover a deleted object in a versioned S3 bucket?
- Use version ID to restore the previous object.
- Optionally remove the delete marker to make the latest version visible.
## What is the difference between strong consistency and eventual consistency in S3?
- Strong consistency: immediately read latest data after PUT/DELETE.
- Eventual consistency: old data may be read for a short period.
- S3 provides strong consistency for all operations.

## How do S3 pre-signed URLs work and what are common use cases?
- Generate URL with temporary credentials & expiry.
- Anyone with URL can access object until expiration.
- Use cases: temporary download, upload by external users, share private content.

## How can you configure server-side encryption for an S3 bucket?
- Bucket-level default or per-object encryption.
- Methods: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C.
- Can enforce via bucket policy.

## What is the difference between SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, and SSE-C?
- SSE-S3: AWS-managed keys (AES-256), simplest.
- SSE-KMS: customer-managed KMS keys, audit logging, more control.
- SSE-C: customer provides key; AWS does not store it.
